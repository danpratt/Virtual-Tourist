## Description

This is an iOS app written in Swift that allows a user to drop a pin on a map, and then see photos taken in that area.

## Technologies Used In Application:

* Swift 3.1
* CoreData
* MapKit
* Flickr's Web API
* UIKit

## Purpose

This app was written as part of Udacity's iOS Degree program.  The main purpose of this app was to learn and explore CoreData.
It also employs  many of the skills learned throughout the duration of this course, including Web API calls, MapKit, GCD, etc.
This app is not intended to be released to the public, however, you are welcome to learn from what is in this project.

## Usage
This app will allow you to drop pins on a world map.  Dropping a pin will load photos near that location from Flickr.  You can tap on the pin and see these images.  Tapping on the edit button on the main map view will allow you to delete pins.  When viewing the photos in a pin, you can tap on the delete button to delete images, or if you like you can reload some fresh images.  Tapping on an image while you are not in delete mode will allow you to view a larger version of the image, and see the image title (if one exists).
